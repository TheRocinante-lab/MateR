# MateR
Genomic Mating package. Uses genomic information to optimize a mating plan, maximizing genetic gain and within family variance (usefulness), as well as genetic diversity. Supports polyploids, multi-trait optimization, additive and dominance effects, directional dominance (inbreeding and heterosis) and the use of testers.
